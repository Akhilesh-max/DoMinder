# DoMinder


## Overview

This is a robust and user-friendly To-Do application built with Angular and TypeScript. Designed as a Single-Page Application (SPA), it provides a seamless user experience with no need for page refreshes.

## Features

- **Create To-Dos**: Add new tasks to your list with ease.
- **Remove To-Dos**: Clean up completed tasks or remove unwanted ones.
- **Mark To-Dos as Done**: Keep track of your progress by marking tasks as done.

## Persistence

One of the standout features of this application is its use of local storage for data persistence. Your To-Dos are saved directly in your browser's local storage, and they persist across sessions. So, even if you close the application or restart your device, your To-Dos will still be there when you come back.

## Tech Stack
